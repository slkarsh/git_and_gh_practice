My favorite travel experience was going to Prague while I was studying abroad in London for my friend's 21st birthday. 
It was perfect because we both have the same travel style - get a vague idea of what we want to see or do, but then no actual schedule
We ate great food, went on an amazing bar crawl, met some cool people, and had the best weekend ever. I still think about it 6 years later and we constantly talk about going back to Prague.
